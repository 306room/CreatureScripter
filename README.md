# CreatureScripter
Scripting of creatures using creature_ai_scripts through a GUI

Using QSpellWorks for getting spell-information.
libmysql for database connectivity.
Qt for pretty much everything else.

Developed with Elysiums world-database, but should be compatibile standard CMangos databases.

Note: QSpellWorks integration is currently a huge hack, and only uses the pre-tbc module.

WIP.
